# Facial Expression Detection – Real-Time Recognition

This project implements a **Real-Time Facial Expression Recognition System** using **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**.  
It detects human faces from a live webcam feed and classifies facial expressions into different emotion categories using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The system performs the following tasks:

1. Captures live video from a webcam  
2. Detects faces in each frame using **OpenCV Haar Cascade**  
3. Preprocesses detected face regions  
4. Predicts facial expressions using a **pretrained CNN model**  
5. Displays the predicted emotion in real time  

This project is intended for **local execution** and real-time experimentation.
